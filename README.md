# Exchanger
This is a web application for an exchange shop, where you can add your permanent customer and manage their transactions, add your expences, calculate your daily and monthly profit and etc. This project builded on PHP, JavaScript, JQuary, HTML, CSS and MySQL.

This project is also one of my first experience in programming so this is the reason that it doesn't have good structure and because I worked offline I download the JQuary library and include it in my project.
It was first time that I tried to gather information from client and build my app according to that requirments and then show the result to client and check the app and then bring some changes and fix buges in it.
I tried to focus on front end and functionality of the app but not backend and structure of files and codes or efficiency of the code, now when I am looking in my code I say to myself "what a mess" :).
I am happy about this because it shows that I learned a lot during this time and I improved but still there are lots of things that I need to learn it is just the beginning of the way.
